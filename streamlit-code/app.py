    **Summary:** Your CBC shows generally normal blood counts, but your hemoglobin is slightly low.
    
    **Recommendations:** Continue iron supplements for 4â€“6 weeks, add iron-rich foods, stay hydrated, avoid dairy near iron doses.

    - Should I repeat CBC after therapy?  
    - Can blood thinner be discontinued?  
    - Would vitamin C improve iron absorption?
