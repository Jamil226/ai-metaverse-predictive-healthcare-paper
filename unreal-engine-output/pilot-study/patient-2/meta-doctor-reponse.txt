I understand your concern, and you’ve done the right thing by sharing your report. Let me explain everything step by step in simple terms. Your report indicates changes in your blood that point toward an infection, and your TB skin test has shown a positive result. This means that you have been exposed to tuberculosis bacteria, and it is possible that the infection is active. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that most often affects the lungs, but it can also impact other parts of the body. It spreads through the air when someone with active TB coughs or sneezes.

At your age, it is particularly important to take these results seriously. Older adults may have a weaker immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections on its own. That is why doctors usually recommend further confirmatory tests, such as a chest X-ray, sputum smear, or GeneXpert test, to determine if the TB is active and in what stage it may be. If active TB is confirmed, treatment generally involves a structured course of antibiotics that must be taken for at least six months. These medicines are very effective but must be taken exactly as prescribed—missing doses or stopping early can make the infection harder to treat.

During treatment, your doctor will likely monitor you with regular checkups to ensure the medicines are working and not causing side effects. Sometimes TB medicines can affect the liver, so your doctor may also recommend periodic blood tests to check your overall health. Along with medication, lifestyle plays an important role: eating a nutritious diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables will strengthen your body, while proper rest and hydration will support healing. It is also advisable to avoid smoking and alcohol during treatment, as they can slow recovery and put extra stress on the body.

The important thing to remember is that TB is treatable and curable with proper care. Many patients at your age recover fully once they start and complete the treatment as advised. While it may feel overwhelming, taking timely action and staying consistent with your doctor’s plan will greatly improve your chances of a smooth recovery.
