Doctor, I am feeling quite worried after seeing my medical report. 
I have uploaded it here for you to review. I donâ€™t fully understand what 
these results mean, but I know that one of the tests shows positive for TB. 
At my age, I am very concerned about my health and what this could mean for me. 
Can you please explain in detail what my report is showing, what tuberculosis really is,
 how serious it can be at my stage of life, and what kind of treatment or precautions I 
 should be considering?
