I’ve reviewed your kidney function test, and your creatinine level is above the normal range. This suggests that your kidneys may not be working at full efficiency and could be under stress. Elevated creatinine can result from dehydration, certain medications, high protein intake, or underlying kidney disease. At your age, it’s important to investigate further to understand the exact cause.
You should increase your water intake (unless your doctor has restricted fluids), avoid overuse of painkillers or unnecessary medications, and limit very high-protein diets as they may burden the kidneys. Since kidney function is essential for overall health, your doctor will likely recommend additional tests such as a urea test, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and possibly an ultrasound to check kidney structure. With timely management, many causes of raised creatinine can be addressed and controlled.
