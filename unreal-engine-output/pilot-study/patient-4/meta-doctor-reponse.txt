I’ve reviewed your liver function test report. The results show that your bilirubin levels are slightly above the normal range, which may indicate mild liver stress or reduced liver clearance. In addition, your liver enzymes (SGPT/ALT and SGOT/AST) are elevated, which usually suggests that the liver cells are irritated or inflamed. This can happen for many reasons, such as fatty liver disease, viral infections like hepatitis, side effects of certain medicines, or even lifestyle-related issues like alcohol use or poor diet. The rest of your liver profile, including proteins and albumin, is within the normal range, which is reassuring and shows that your liver is still functioning well overall.
At this stage, there is no need for panic, but it’s important not to ignore these findings. I recommend avoiding alcohol, reducing fried and oily foods, staying hydrated, and maintaining a healthy weight. Since these abnormalities may also relate to medicines or underlying conditions, it would be wise to discuss these results with a liver specialist (hepatologist) who may suggest additional tests, such as an ultrasound or viral hepatitis screening, to find the exact cause. With the right treatment and lifestyle adjustments, many liver issues can be managed effectively.
