Thank you for explaining your symptoms. Persistent stomach pain, bloating, nausea, and heartburn after meals often point to digestive system issues such as gastritis, acid reflux (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, or indigestion due to diet and lifestyle factors. In some cases, infections like Helicobacter pylori (a bacteria linked to ulcers) or use of painkillers and certain medications can also cause these symptoms.
At your age, itâ€™s important not to ignore ongoing digestive discomfort. The next steps usually include an abdominal ultrasound and possibly a gastroscopy (endoscopy) to look directly at the stomach lining and check for ulcers or inflammation. Your doctor may also recommend a simple stool test or blood test to check for infections or underlying conditions.
While waiting for your medical evaluation, you can take supportive steps: avoid spicy and oily foods, reduce caffeine and alcohol intake, eat smaller and more frequent meals, and avoid lying down immediately after eating. Drinking enough water and managing stress can also help, since stress often worsens stomach symptoms.
If you experience severe pain, vomiting blood, black stools, or sudden weight loss, you should seek urgent medical care as these can be signs of more serious conditions. With proper diagnosis and treatment, most gastrointestinal issues can be managed effectively and comfortably.
