I am 47 years old and for the past few weeks I’ve had a persistent cough that doesn’t seem to go away. Sometimes I feel short of breath, especially when climbing stairs, and I also notice some chest tightness at night. I haven’t done any tests yet. Could this be something serious, and what should I do next?
