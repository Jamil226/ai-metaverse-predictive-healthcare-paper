I’ve reviewed your chemistry report dated 29-Jan-2024. 
Your random blood glucose level is 112 mg/dL, which lies well within the normal 
reference range of 80–200 mg/dL. This indicates that your blood sugar at the time 
of testing was stable and does not suggest diabetes or hypoglycemia. Since this is a 
random test, it only reflects your glucose level at that moment; for a more reliable 
assessment of blood sugar control, doctors usually recommend a fasting blood glucose 
test or an HbA1c test, which shows average levels over the past 2–3 months. 
Based on this report alone, there are no urgent concerns, and your result is reassuring. 
However, if you have risk factors such as family history of diabetes, frequent thirst, 
unexplained weight changes, or fatigue, follow-up testing could be helpful. 
Maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, proper hydration, and good sleep are all 
important for keeping your blood sugar within range.
