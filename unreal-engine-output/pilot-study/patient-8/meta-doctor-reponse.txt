Your symptoms of tiredness, weight gain without much change in eating, and dry skin can indeed be linked to thyroid imbalance, particularly an underactive thyroid, also called hypothyroidism. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that controls metabolism, and when it slows down, the body processes also slow down, leading to fatigue, weight changes, constipation, hair loss, and even mood changes in some cases.
At your age, it’s quite important to get this evaluated properly because untreated hypothyroidism can affect heart health, cholesterol levels, and overall energy. The next step would be to get a thyroid function test, which includes TSH, T3, and T4 levels. This simple blood test will show whether your thyroid is underactive or overactive. Depending on the result, your doctor may recommend thyroid medication, which usually helps restore balance and relieves symptoms.
Meanwhile, you can take some supportive steps: maintain a balanced diet with adequate iodine (found in iodized salt and seafood), stay physically active, and ensure you’re getting enough sleep. Keep a note of your symptoms and when they worsen, as this will help your doctor. If you experience sudden swelling in your neck, very fast heartbeat, or extreme fatigue, seek medical attention promptly.
