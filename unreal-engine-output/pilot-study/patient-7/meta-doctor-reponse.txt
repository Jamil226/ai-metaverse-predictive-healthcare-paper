At the age of 64, your symptoms of a racing heartbeat and breathlessness on exertion are important to take seriously. While sometimes these symptoms can be linked to anxiety, low fitness, or lifestyle habits, they may also signal heart-related conditions such as arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), early coronary artery disease, or even high blood pressure. Because the heart and lungs work closely together, it’s also possible that lung issues like asthma or chronic bronchitis could contribute.
The next step should be a proper evaluation by a cardiologist. Commonly recommended tests include an ECG to check your heart rhythm, an echocardiogram to look at your heart’s pumping function, and possibly a stress test to see how your heart behaves during exertion. It may also be useful to check cholesterol and blood sugar levels, since these can increase heart risks at your age. 
While waiting for your appointment, you can take some practical precautions: avoid excess caffeine, smoking, or alcohol; eat a diet that is light on salt and rich in vegetables, fruits, and lean protein; and pace your physical activities so you don’t overstrain. Keep a diary of when these symptoms occur, how long they last, and what triggers them, as this information will be valuable for your doctor. Most importantly, if you ever feel chest pain, severe dizziness, or fainting, you should seek immediate medical care without delay.
