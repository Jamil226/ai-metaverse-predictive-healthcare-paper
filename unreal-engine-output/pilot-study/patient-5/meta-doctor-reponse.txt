Iâ€™ve reviewed your fasting blood glucose report, and your result is slightly above the normal range, which places it in the prediabetes category. This does not mean you have diabetes, but it shows that your body is starting to struggle with maintaining normal blood sugar levels. At this stage, it is possible to bring your sugar levels back under control with lifestyle changes, which is very encouraging.
The most important steps include adopting a balanced diet that is low in refined sugars and processed foods, eating more whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins, and staying physically active with at least 30 minutes of walking or light exercise most days of the week. Maintaining a healthy weight and getting good quality sleep are also very important for blood sugar regulation.
Since prediabetes can progress to diabetes if not managed, regular monitoring is essential. Your doctor may recommend repeating fasting glucose, doing an HbA1c test to check your average sugar levels over the past few months, or an oral glucose tolerance test for more detail. The good news is that many people in the prediabetic stage reverse the condition by making consistent lifestyle changes.
