To improve your sleep, try practicing deep breathing by inhaling slowly, holding briefly, and exhaling gently to calm your body. You can also use progressive muscle relaxation—tensing and releasing each muscle group from your feet up to your head—to ease physical tension. Creating a sleep-friendly environment with a quiet, cool, and dark room, avoiding screens before bed, and doing light stretches or gentle yoga can also help you relax. Writing down worries or tasks before bedtime may clear your mind and make it easier to fall asleep.
