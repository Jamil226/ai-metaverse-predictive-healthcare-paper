Thank you for sharing your symptoms. A cough lasting for weeks, combined with shortness of breath and chest tightness, does need careful attention. While it can sometimes be caused by minor issues such as allergies, asthma, or lingering infections, it may also be related to more significant conditions like chronic bronchitis, early signs of asthma, pneumonia, or in rare cases, tuberculosis or lung disease. At your age, it’s important not to ignore these signs.
The first step is to get a chest X-ray and possibly a spirometry test (lung function test) to see how well your lungs are working. If you have risk factors such as smoking history, exposure to dust or pollution, or family history of lung problems, these will be important to mention to your doctor. Blood tests or a sputum test may also be recommended if an infection or TB needs to be ruled out.
In the meantime, avoid smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke, keep your environment dust-free, and try using warm fluids or steam inhalation to soothe your airways. If your symptoms worsen — especially if you cough up blood, develop high fever, or experience severe breathlessness — you should seek medical care urgently.
The good news is that many causes of chronic cough and breathlessness can be managed effectively with timely diagnosis and treatment.
